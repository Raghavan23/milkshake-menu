# milkshake-menu
A simple React project that displays a stylish milkshake menu. The menu items are rendered dynamically from a JavaScript data array, with support for conditional UI (sold-out states, open/close hours). Built to practice React components, props, conditional rendering, and styling.



# 🥤 Shakes & Co. – Milkshake Menu

A simple React project that displays a stylish milkshake menu with dynamic data. Built to practice **React components, props, conditional rendering, and styling**.



## 🚀 Features

🍹 Static React App – The app doesn’t fetch from an API, but uses a local JavaScript array (milkshakeData) as the source of truth.

📝 Dynamic Rendering – Milkshake items are generated automatically from the array using React’s .map(), so adding a new milkshake only requires updating the data.

❌ Sold-Out Handling – Items marked as soldOut: true appear grayed out with a “SOLD OUT” label.

🕒 Open/Close Hours – Footer text updates based on the current time (open/closed message).

🎨 Custom Styling – Built with CSS Grid & Flexbox for a clean, responsive layout.

💲 Price Formatting – Prices include a dollar symbol and update with the data.

## 📖 Learning Goals

This project helped me practice:

* Using **props** to pass data into components
* **Conditional rendering** (open/close hours, sold out items)
* Structuring and styling with **CSS**

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Add a **cart/order system**
* Fetch milkshake data from an API instead of hardcoding
* Add animations/transitions for a smoother UI
